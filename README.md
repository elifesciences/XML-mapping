# XML-mapping

This repository contains the 'kitchen sink' article XML that captures how eLife models article data in XML.

Updates to the XML are demonstrated here as feature branches to help downstream changes.

Usage of the kitchen sink as a test fixture along with it's dependencies should be consolidated here.

## kitchen sink XML

### elife-1234567890-v1.xml

Forked from `elife-00666.xml` 2021-08-12, the manuscript ID `666` was conflicting with the *actual* 
[article 666](https://elifesciences.org/articles/00666) and causing problems during testing.

The new MSID is hopefully very obviously fake.

### elife-00666.xml

The original kitchen sink, kept until all organisation references are updated but otherwise archived.

Do not use, to be removed.

### elife-00777.xml

Non-research "feature" content.
